## Problem Statement

A JavaScript application simulating house automation: Pressing a button on a control panel would visually turn on a light, change the temperature or close the curtains. Some constraints:

1. The application must use jQuery
2. The components must have HTTP based "server" interaction (use a static file for simplicity, data persistence is not required). For example, the heating component retrieves the current temperature from the server and also sends the desired one back to the server.


## Development model

A simple AngularJS application has been developed based on the requirements. jQuery has been utilized to listen to various events. The API request's response has been mocked and included in temp.json file. There are no server side code involved.

## Technology requirements

You should install Node, Grunt and Bower globally before proceeding, it'll make the process much easier. You'll only need these prequisites if you're planning on doing development, otherwise everything should run directly out of the src/main/www folder anyway.

1. [Node.js] (http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. [Grunt] (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
3. [Bower] (http://bower.io/)

Once these 3 are installed simply do 

```javascript
npm install
```
This will fetch all the dependies from package.json

```javascript
grunt serve
```
This will serve the application using node.js running on 5050 port

```javascript
grunt
```
This will create a home.war file inside /dist folder

## Attachments

1. If you want to run the application on a web-server, simply deploy the "home.war" file on a web-server (e.g: tomcat)
2. The whole project is also attached as a .rar file in addition to files seperately
